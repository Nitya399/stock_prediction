 📈 Stock Trend Prediction using Machine Learning
                                                                 
🚀 Overview

This project is a Stock Trend Prediction Web Application built using Python, Streamlit, and LSTM-based Deep Learning models. The app allows users to enter a stock ticker symbol, fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance, and predicts future trends based on machine learning techniques.

✨ Features

📊 Stock Data Extraction: Fetches historical stock data (2010-2019) using the Yahoo Finance API.
📈 Time-Series Analysis: Implements 100-day & 200-day moving averages for trend analysis.
🤖 LSTM Model for Prediction: Uses a pre-trained LSTM model to forecast stock prices.
🎨 Interactive Visualization: Plots actual vs. predicted prices using Matplotlib.
🖥️ User-Friendly Interface: Built with Streamlit for real-time stock analysis.

🔧 Technologies Used

Python
Streamlit
TensorFlow/Keras
Pandas & NumPy
Matplotlib & Seaborn
